[Primer Spec](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec) is a Jekyll theme that makes long informative web pages easier to read. In addition to aesthetic styling, the theme generates a table of contents displayed in a sidebar.

The theme was developed for Computer Science course websites at the University of Michigan. Our course project specifications tend to be long — this theme aims to make these specifications more accessible to students. See our [User Showcase](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec#user-showcase) for examples of how this theme is being used.

Adding this theme to your own long pages is easy! See the [Usage](https://github.com/eecs485staff/primer-spec#usage) instructions to quickly try it out.
